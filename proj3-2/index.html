		<h1> Overview </h1>
		<p> In this project, we implemented some additional pathtracing tools that allow us to create realistic depictions of scenes. First, we implement light models for glass materials. This is done by combining mirror models (perfect specular reflection) with specular refraction (light that passes through glass). Then, we explore a thin lens camera model. A thin lens model takes into account the aperture of the lens and focal distance to give a more realistic camera effect and allow us to play with depth of field.

		<h1> Part 1 </h1>
    <p>
		The way we implement the glass model is by using the Schick's reflection coefficient as an approximation for the ratio of light that is reflected versus refracted. Then, we sample this Bernoulli distribution with each ray that intersects the glass to either calculate the light arriving from perfect specular reflection, or specular refraction. The refracted light ray is calculated using Snell's law and the index of refraction of the material, while angle of reflected light is mirrored by the normal vector of the surface.

	 <h1> Part 4 </h1>
	 A pinhole camera simply assumes that all light rays from a scene onto a screen pass through a single point. The thin-lens model generalizes the pinhole model to a disk. For any pair of points on the screen and focal distance plane that are intersected by a ray that passes through the pinhole, any other ray from the scene that intersects the disk will also be refracted to the same point in the scene. This is due to a convex lens designed for a specific focal distance. Given a point on the screen, we can implement this by finding a ray that passes through the pinhole camera located at the center of the disk and find where it intersects the focal plane. Then, we sample a point on the disk and generate a ray from that point to the point on the focal plane.

	As expected, higher focal distance results in further parts of the scene coming into focus.

At aperture size = 0, the camera acts like a pinhole. As we increase the aperture size, the angles of rays that are refracted by our lens increase, meaning that the rays diverge from the focal plane more. This results in a small field of focus.
